  // HACK: We have to manually track disposal, too, to workaround a bug with
  // multiple timer hooks. This shouldn't be necessary - the `effect` hook
  // without `OnMountAndIf` should be handling disposal completely for us!

  // However, there is a bug when there are multiple timer hooks used -
  // if they are toggled on and off independently, we can get into a state
  // where a hanging ticker is left.

  // This is a very bad state because it will cause the UI to constantly
  // re-render, and be expensive for both CPU and battery life!

  // See the test case in:
  // test/UI/HooksTest.re that manifests this bug

  // Ideally, we can fix the underlying bug (perhaps in the effect hook),
  // and remove this hack while keeping all those tests green.

  // It's easy to hit when there are multiple springs associated with a component,
  // which each use an underlying timer.
